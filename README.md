## 🧠 Inspiration
Inspired by the Pomodoro technique developed by [Francesco Cirillo](https://www.francescocirillo.com), MyPomo aims to balance deep work with refreshing breaks.

## 🚀 How to use
1. Select a session: Pomodoro, 5-min break, or 15-min break.
2. Hit “Start” to begin the timer.
3. “Pause” or “Reset” as needed to manage your flow.
